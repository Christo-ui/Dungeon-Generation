Maze generation uses depth first search, and trees to generate the paths. The paths for the maze is made by choosing a random direction from 4 
possible directions and is then repeated inside a recursive function. If there are no possible moves you move up the tree until you reach the 
root node. Rooms are placed in a region and a maze is then built around those rooms. Sometimes rooms can be disconnected from the main maze but 
this should be easy to fix if I find the motivation to do that.

Overall just a fun little project.
Made at the end of my grade 12 year.
